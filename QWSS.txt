Quick walkthrough about my Skillsets:
Brief:
Git/GitHub:

Version Control: Manage and track versions of code, enabling multiple developers to work on the same project without conflicts.
Collaboration: Facilitate team collaboration through pull requests, code reviews, and issue tracking.
Branch Management: Create and manage branches for feature development, bug fixes, and experimentation.
Release Management: Tag and release versions of software, maintain release notes, and manage deployment.
Jenkins:

Continuous Integration (CI): Automatically test code changes to ensure they don't break the build or introduce bugs.
Continuous Deployment (CD): Automate the deployment process, ensuring that new code changes are automatically and reliably deployed to production.
Build Automation: Compile, build, and package software automatically.
Pipeline Orchestration: Create and manage complex workflows that define how software is built, tested, and deployed.
Ansible:

Configuration Management: Standardize and automate the setup of servers and applications.
Application Deployment: Automate the deployment of applications across various environments.
Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Manage and provision infrastructure through code, ensuring environment consistency.
Automation of Repetitive Tasks: Automate routine tasks like system updates, user management, and software installations.
Docker:

Containerization: Package applications and their dependencies into containers for consistent deployment across different environments.
Isolation: Run applications in isolated environments to prevent conflicts and ensure security.
Microservices Architecture: Facilitate the development and deployment of microservices by containerizing individual services.
Development Environment Standardization: Create consistent development environments that mirror production settings.
Kubernetes:

Container Orchestration: Manage and scale containers across multiple hosts.
Load Balancing: Automatically distribute application traffic across containers for better performance and reliability.
Self-healing Systems: Automatically replace containers that fail, ensuring high availability.
Automated Rollouts/Rollbacks: Manage application updates and rollbacks, minimizing downtime and risks.
Apache Tomcat:

Web Application Deployment: Deploy and manage Java-based web applications.
Performance Tuning: Optimize the performance of web applications by tuning Tomcat settings.
Security Management: Implement security measures for web applications, including SSL/TLS configuration and access control.
Logging and Monitoring: Monitor application performance and troubleshoot issues using Tomcat's logging capabilities.



1. Code Collaborations --> GIT


Git is a distributed version control system, widely used for source code management in software development. It allows multiple developers to work on a single project without conflicting with each other's changes

REMEMBER: WORKFLOW --> WSLR (WORKING DIRECTORY -- STAGING AREA -- LOCAL REPO -- REMOTE REPO)

* git init: Initializes a new Git repository. This command creates a new subdirectory named .git that houses all of your project's history and configuration settings.

* git clone [URL]: Creates a copy of an existing Git repository. The URL points to the repository you want to clone, which could be located on a remote server like GitHub, GitLab, etc.

* git add [file]: Stages a file for commit. This command tells Git that you want to include updates to a particular file in the next commit. However, git add doesn't affect the repository until you run git commit.

* git commit -m "[commit message]": Records changes to the repository. The -m flag allows you to add a commit message in-line. Commit messages are important for explaining what changes you've made.

* git status: Displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. It lets you see which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git.

* git push [alias] [branch]: Uploads your commits to a remote repository. The alias is usually origin, and the branch is the branch you want to push.

* git pull [alias] [branch]: Fetches and merges changes from a remote repository into your local branch. The alias and branch are usually the remote repository and branch you want to pull from.

* git branch: Lists, creates, or deletes branches. Branches are used to work on different versions of a repository at one time.

* git checkout [branch]: Switches to a specified branch and updates the working directory. This command is used to switch between different branches in a repository.

* git merge [branch]: Merges the specified branch’s history into the current branch. This is a common way to combine changes from one branch into another.

* git diff: Shows the file differences which are not yet staged.

* git reset: Resets the staging area to match the most recent commit, but leaves the working directory unchanged. It's a way to undo changes that haven't been committed yet.

* git log: Displays the commit history for the current branch, showing a list of commits with their details.

* git fetch [alias]: Downloads content from a remote repository, but it doesn't integrate any of these new data into your working files. Fetch is great for getting a fresh view on all the things that happened in a remote repository.

* git rm [file]: Removes files from the working directory and stages the deletion.

* git stash: Temporarily stores all the modified tracked files. This is useful for saving your work-in-progress changes without committing them, so you can switch branches and work on something else.

* git stash pop: Applies stashed changes back to your working directory and removes them from the stash list.

* git rebase [branch]: Moves or combines a sequence of commits to a new base commit. Rebasing is a way to reapply commits on top of another base tip.

* git cherry-pick [commit]: Applies the changes introduced by some existing commits. This command is useful for applying a few commits from one branch onto another.

* git revert [commit]: Creates a new commit that undoes all of the changes made in a specified commit, then applies it to the current branch.

* git tag [tag-name]: Marks a specific point in the repository’s history as important. Typically, this is used to mark release points (v1.0, v2.0 and so on).

* git remote add [alias] [url]: Adds a remote repository to your project. The alias is a shorthand name for the remote URL.

* git remote -v: Lists all the remote connections you have to other repositories.

* git fetch --all: Fetches all registered remotes and their branches.

* git pull --rebase [alias] [branch]: This is a combination of fetch and rebase instead of fetch and merge. This command is used when you want to reapply your local changes on top of the remote changes.

* git config: Lets you view and set configuration options. For example, you can set your username and email, which are important for commit messages.

* git blame [file]: Shows who last modified each line of a file. This is useful for understanding who made specific changes.

* git log --graph: Shows the commit history in a graphical representation.

* git bisect: Used to find the commit that introduced a bug by using a binary search algorithm.

* git show [commit]: Shows various types of objects (commits, tags, etc.), typically used to view information about a specific commit.
